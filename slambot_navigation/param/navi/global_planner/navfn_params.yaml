NavfnROS:
  ## allow_unknown (bool, default: true)
  ## Specifies whether or not to allow navfn to create plans that traverse unknown space.
  ## <NOTE> if you are using a layered costmap_2d costmap with a voxel or obstacle layer, you must also set the track_unknown_space param for that layer to be true, or it will convert all your unknown space to free space (which navfn will then happily go right through).
  allow_unknown: true

  ## planner_window_x (double, default: 0.0)
  ## Specifies the x size of an optional window to restrict the planner to.
  ## This can be useful for restricting NavFn to work in a small window of a large costmap.
  planner_window_x: 0.0

  ## planner_window_y (double, default: 0.0)
  ## Specifies the y size of an optional window to restrict the planner to.
  ## This can be useful for restricting NavFn to work in a small window of a large costmap.
  planner_window_y: 0.0

  ## default_tolerance (double, default: 0.0)
  ## A tolerance on the goal point for the planner.
  ## NavFn will attempt to create a plan that is as close to the specified goal as possible but no further than default_tolerance away. 
  default_tolerance: 0.0

  ## visualize_potential (bool, default: false)
  ## Specifies whether or not to visualize the potential area computed by navfn via a PointCloud2.
  visualize_potential: false
