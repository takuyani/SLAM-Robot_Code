## ~scan_height (int, default: 1 pixel)
## The number of pixel rows to use to generate the laserscan.
## For each column, the scan will return the minimum value for those pixels centered vertically in the image.
scan_height: 10

## ~scan_time (double, default: 1/30.0Hz (0.033s))
## Time between scans (seconds).
## Typically, 1.0/frame_rate.
## This value is not easily calculated from consecutive messages, and is thus left to the user to set correctly.
#scan_time:

## ~range_min (double, default: 0.45m)
## The minimum ranges to return in meters.
## Ranges less than this will be output as -Inf.
range_min: 0.45

## ~range_max (double, default: 10.0m)
## The maximum ranges to return in meters.
## Ranges greater than this will be output as +Inf.
range_max: 10.0

## ~output_frame_id (str, default: camera_depth_frame)
## The frame id of the laser scan.
## For point clouds coming from an "optical" frame with Z forward, this value should be set to the corresponding frame with X forward and Z up.
output_frame_id: "xtion_pro_live_depth_frame"
